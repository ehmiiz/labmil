# Labmil - easy hyper-v labbing

## The gist of it

- Labmil is a module to easily spin up a standard set of hyper-v machines
- The idea being that the servers are just named, started and iso attached
- The roles has to be installed by hand and all configs manually (or with own script) to increase the labbing!

## Requires

- Hyper-V enabled Windows OS
- an iso-file moved into the ISO folder
